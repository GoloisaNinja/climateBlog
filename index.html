    <h3 style="text-align:center;">CLIMATE CRISIS AND THE SERIOUS RISKS POSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE</h3>
    <h5>DISEASE</h5>
    <p style="font-weight: light;">The climate crisis is making people sicker—worsening illnesses ranging from seasonal allergies to heart and lung disease.

        Children, pregnant people and the elderly are the most at risk from extreme weather and rising heat. But the impact of the climate crisis—for patients, doctors and researchers—is already being felt across every specialty of medicine, with worse feared to come.
        
        “There’s research suggesting that our prescription medications may be causing harm because of changing heat patterns,” said Aaron Bernstein, a pediatric hospitalist who is the co-director of the Center for Climate, Health and the Global Environment at Harvard University. 
        
        “There’s evidence that extreme weather events are affecting critical medical supplies so we can’t do things as we normally would do because IV fluids aren’t available.

        “And there’s evidence that extreme weather events are knocking out power more and more, and that is a huge issue for providing care in healthcare facilities.”

        In a recent example, a study in the Journal of the American Medical Associationfound that lung cancer patients undergoing radiation were less likely to survive when hurricane disasters disrupted their treatments.

        An August article in the New England Journal of Medicine lays out dozens of similar studies to show how the climate crisis affects each practice of medicine. Renee Salas, a co-author of the report, who teaches emergency medicine at Harvard Medical Schoolsaid: “The climate crisis is impacting not only health for our patients but the way we deliver care and our ability to do our jobs. And that’s happening today.”
        <h5>ALLERGIES</h5>

        As temperatures increase, plants produce more pollen for longer periods of time, intensifying the allergy seasons. Increased concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can make plants grow more and cause more grass pollen, which causes allergies in about 20% of people. Carbon dioxide can also increase the allergy-causing effects of pollen.

        Neelu Tummala, an ear, nose and throat specialist at the George Washington Medical Faculty Associates in Washington DC, said she sees many patients with allergic rhinitis, or inflammation of the nasal cavity, congestion and post-nasal drip.

        “It used to be that tree pollens were only in spring, grasses were just in summer, ragweed was just in fall,” Tummala said. “But the timing of those is starting to overlap more.”

    </div>


    <p style="font-weight: light;">One of Tummala’s patients, Kelly Kenney, had minor seasonal allergies as a child but now suffers from year-round from sinus pains, ear pressure and congestion.

    “The last four years, my symptoms have gotten increasingly worse,” Kenney said.

    <h5>BABY MAKERS</h5>

    Pregnant people are more vulnerable to heat and the air pollution that is being made worse by climate change.

    Bruce Bekkar, a San Diego-based obstetrician gynecologist who stopped practicing six years ago to spend more time as a climate activist, has compiled 68 studies from the continental US on the association between heat, smog and the tiny particles of pollution that come from fossil fuels and how they are connected with premature birth, low birth weight and stillbirth.

    More smog forms when it is hot, and some research suggests particulate matter also increases with the climate crisis, although the data is less robust.

    Bekkar said he and his co-authors found a significant association in 58 of the 68 studies. The body of research covers 30m births in the US.

    Bekkar said doctors should talk to their patients about how heat waves could lead to premature births and how staying away from air pollution can help them keep their children healthy.

            <h3 style="text-align:center;">WHAT IF THE SHIP HAS SAILED</h3>
            <h5>CATASTROPHIC RISK</h5>
            <p style="font-weight: light;">The risk of catastrophic climate change is getting worse, according to a new study from scientists involved with the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Threats—ranging from the destruction of coral reefs to more extreme weather events like hurricanes, droughts and floods—are becoming more likely at the temperature change already underway: as little as 1.8 degree Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) of warming in global average temperatures.

                "Most people thought that the risks were going to be for certain species and poor people. But all of a sudden the European heat wave of 2003 comes along and kills 50,000, [Hurricane] Katrina comes along and there's a lot of data about the increased intensity of droughts and floods. Plus, the dramatic melting of Greenland that nobody can explain certainly has to increase your concern," says climatologist Stephen Schneider of Stanford University, who co-authored the research published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences as well as in several IPCC reports. "Everywhere we looked, there was evidence that what was believed to be likely has happened. Nature has been cooperating with [climate change] theory unfortunately."
                
                Schneider and his colleagues updated a graph, dubbed the "burning embers," that is designed to map the risks of damage from global warming. The initial version of the graph [left] drawn in 2001 had the risks of climate change beginning to appear after 3.6 or 5.4 degrees F (2 to 3 degrees C) of warming, but the years since have shown that climate risks kick in with less warming.
                
            </p>
            <h5>ADAPT OR DIE</h5>

            <p style="font-weight: light;">According to the new graph, risks to "unique and threatened systems" such as coral reefs and risks of extreme weather events become likely when temperatures rise by as little as 1.8 degrees F from 1990 levels, which is on course to occur by mid-century given the current concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases. In addition, risks of negative consequences such as increased droughts and the complete melting of ice caps in Greenland and Antarctica definitively outweigh any potential positives, such as longer growing seasons in countries such as Canada and Russia.

            "We're definitely going to overshoot some of these temperatures where we see these very large vulnerabilities manifest," says economist Gary Yohe of Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., another co-author. "We're going to have to learn how to adapt."
            </p>

            <h5>POLICY SCHMOLICY</h5>

            <p style="font-weight: light;">Adaptation notwithstanding, Yohe and Schneider say that scientists must also figure out a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reverse the heating trend to prevent further damage.

                Several bills pending in Congress would set a so-called cap-and-trade policy under which an overall limit on pollution would be set—and companies with low output could sell their allowances to those that fail to cut emissions as long as the total stays within the total pollution cap. Any such federal policy would put a price on carbon dioxide pollution, which is currently free to vent into the atmosphere, Yohe note. He, however, favors  a so-called carbon tax that would set a fixed price for such climate-changing pollution rather than the cap-and-trade proposals favored by the Obama administration. "It's a predictable price, not a thing that bounces around."

            <p style="font-weight: light;">
        
            But even with such policies in place—not only in the U.S. but across the globe—climate change is a foregone conclusion; global average temperatures have already risen by at least 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit (0.6 degree C) and further warming of at least 0.7 degree F (0.4 degree C) is virtually certain, according to the IPCC. And a host of studies, including a recent one from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have shown that global warming is already worse than predicted even a few years ago. The question is: Will it be catastrophic or not? "We've dawdled, and if we dawdle more it will get even worse," Schneider says. "It's time to move."

            <h5>CAR BATTERIES</h5>
            <p style="font-weight: light;">It's perfectly legal to dump car batteries in the ocean. For centuries it's been the absolute best way to dispose of your unwanted
                car batteries.  Ancient dig sites near Mesopotamia have unearthed thousands of tons of old used car batteries in mass graves thought at that time to have been covered in clean, crisp ocean water.
                Car batteries are a nuisance and on top of that, they are heavy. No one likes heavy things. 
                <h5>NOW IS NOW - THE TIME IS ALSO NOW</h5>
        
                If you don't chuck your used car batteries in the ocean now, guess when you'll get to?  Fucking Never.  Want to know why? Greta Thrumburg or some such nonsense.  Everyone is crying
                about climate change. So before they start making dumb new laws that fly in the face of the ancient Mesopotamians, you need to throw your dirty acidic car batteries in the ocean as quickly 
                as possible. The ocean is literally already fucked people. You can't hurt it any worse. Do you think mermaids care if there is one more battery in their clamshell house?  Maybe don't live in clamshells.  Morons.
